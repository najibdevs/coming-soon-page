# Ping coming soon page

The project is a "coming soon" web page for a product or service named "Ping." It aims to build anticipation by allowing visitors to subscribe to updates via email and connect through social media links. The page features a simple, visually appealing design with an email subscription form, social media icons, and an announcement about the upcoming launch.

# Overview

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address and see if it is correct or wrong

## Live Demo

Live Site URL: [ping coming soon page](https://coming-soon-page-nine-kappa.vercel.app/)

# My Process

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## What I Learned
- I reinforced my knowledge by doing a similar project to the newsletter

## What I Could Improve On
- Focusing on writing clean code
- In JavaScript, I'll enhance email validation for accuracy and ensure the script enhances user experience without hindering accessibility.
- Work on more javascript projects
- I will ensure the site is accessible with screen readers, has a fallback when JavaScript is disabled, and performs consistently across different browsers.
